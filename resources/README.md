# Resources

Use this folder to do the following:

1. Add useful links to this file.
2. Upload files to this directory.

- Do not upload really large files like ISO files. GitHub is not designed for this.
- If you _must_ store a large file somewhere, consider storing it on a server on our competition network, and remove it before attack phase starts unless it's necessary to keep it.

## Competition links

- [IScore](https://iscore.iseage.org/)
- [ISEAGE VCenter/VSphere Site](https://vcenter.iseage.org/)
- [Competition Docs on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vglw3iMGlacdrVnlQSni57NSU9l4fYb3)

- The [A-poc/BlueTeam-Tools](https://github.com/A-poc/BlueTeam-Tools?tab=readme-ov-file) repo has a number of tools that can be useful for Blue Teams. Don't get too distracted, though! Use anything you can use for this competition, but leave the rest for after the competition.
- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) is a site with many decoders and encoders.
- [ISEAGE Hashcat Script](https://github.com/DarkStar7471/iseage-hashcat-script). This is five years old. It might be what they use to crack `/etc/shadow` hashes after they get that file from unprotected servers.
- [hashcat-runner-isucdc](https://github.com/cf8geek/hashcat-runner-isucdc). This is only 6 months old, and is runnable on CUDA.
