Private repo for 2024 Innovate IT CDC.

## Use Issues to track work that needs to be done

- Keep discussions about issues there.
- Think about the right level of granularity when you enter new issues so that relevant comments are easy to follow
- Resolve the issue promptly when you have completed the work so that others know not to try to do work that is already complete
- I'll show you how this works at our first Tuesday meeting

## Folders

- `./src`
  - We need to put any source code we need to work on in this folder
  - Each project gets its own folder under `./src`
  - I'll show you how we'll use this at our first Tuesday meeting
- `./resources`
  - We can put links on the `README` file in this directory.
  - If we find any files we want to have access to, they can be stored here as well
    - However, we do NOT want to store really large files in GitHub. Really large files should be stored on servers in our competition network.

## Server snapshots

- Short and sweet: don't change anything until there is a snapshot of the server. We should consider how frequently we want to take snapshots.
- Altenitively: Make a snapshot then change things.
