# Source folder

I don't know if we can do this because not that many people have used our GitHub repo, so we'll look at this Tuesday and decide if we're good with this, if we need to refine these ideas, or if we need a different plan altogether.

## How to manage source code

For any codebase on our servers that you want to change, do the following:

1. Create a new folder with the same name that the folder has on the server
2. Copy the code base into that folder
3. Make changes locally or on the server
4. When you have changes you want to save:

- Copy the codebase to your local repo
- Commit the changes locally
- Pull, then push.
